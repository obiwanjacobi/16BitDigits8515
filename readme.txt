This project is a four-digit 7-segments display that decodes 16-bit of data into a hexadecimal notation.

Uses an ATmega8515 to read the 16 input bits and multiplex a common cathode 4-digit 7-segment display.

Folders:
--------
KiCad	                  - contains the schematic and a rough board layout.
FourSevenSegment8515      - contains the Arduino sketch for the ATmega8515 with instructions how to program.
